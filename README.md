Sketch Plugin: Select Group Layers
================================

[![Greenkeeper badge](https://badges.greenkeeper.io/mattmcmanus/select-group-layers-sketch-plugin.svg)](https://greenkeeper.io/)
Make it easy to select a group of layers at once! All you need is **Cmd + Alt + a**!

If you have a group selected, **Cmd + Alt + a** will select all of the group's child layers

If you have an individual layer already selected, hitting **Cmd + Alt + a** will select all of the layer's peers
