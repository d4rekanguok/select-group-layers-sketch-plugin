Sketch Plugin: Select Group Layers
================================
Make it easy to select a group of layers at once! All you need is **Ctrl + Alt + A**!

If you have a group selected, **Ctrl + Alt + A** will select all of the group's child layers

If you have an individual layer already selected, hitting **Ctrl + Alt + A** will select all of the layer's peers
